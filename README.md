# VBA-challenge

# I used tutoring to get some logic on conditional formatting, and using constant to make it more clear. 

# Also, used AI to make my formatting clear because I'd constantly have errors when ruuning my VBA code. 


# I constantly was told by the tutor to make sure all my coding had a comment to understand more clear each step and see what I needed to make sure I coded everything correctly
